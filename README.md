# Getting Started with Python
Hello, and welcome to Python: Getting Started, My name is Vaibhav Srivastava, and I’m looking forward to helping you learn this powerful and versatile language.
Along the way, you’re going to be learning about things like syntax, functions, and classes, exploring how 
to create a console application and how to convert that same app into a web app, as well learn how to create 
executable files and an installation wizard from your Python app. In addition to Python, you’ll also be using 
Flask and Pycharm. This is a beginner-friendly course, but you’ll want to make sure you’re already up to speed 
on programming basics, such as what a function does and what a variable is. So if you’re ready to get going, 
Python: Getting Started is waiting for you. Thanks again for visiting me here !
